## Euler Help (euler_help)

A collection of helper functions for Project Euler, most of which I wouldn't expect to have much applicability outside Project Euler. For information about Project Euler head here: <https://projecteuler.net/about>.

## Usage

The functions are currently grouped into three files:
  + _algebra.py
  + _euler.py
  + _num2words.py
They can each be used independently.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
